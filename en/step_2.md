## First quest

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
The first quest will be a **fetch quest** where a non-player character (NPC) asks the player to find an item and bring it back to them. 

When the Player returns to the Quest Giver, they will be rewarded with experience points (XP) or a reward in the currency of your game.

This project builds on the project you made in the [World builder](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/world-builder){:target='_blank'} project. 

Open your project to use as the world, or map, where quests will take place.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Game Designer**</span> creates the characters, rules, goals, game mechanics, and puzzles that make a game enjoyable and engaging for the player. Some Game Designers do all the coding for their game and others work in teams.

**Design:** Think of a quest that makes sense in the world you have built. 

You will need to decide on:
+ An item to be fetched
+ A non-player character (NPC) to give the quest to the player
+ The messages for the NPC to display before and after the quest is completed
+ A reward of experience points or currency (coins or gems) in your game

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add a GameObject for the item that the Player will need to fetch. 

Position the item in your world so the Player will need to move from their starting position to find it.

[[[unity-item-model]]]

Add a NPC to be a Quest Giver and position it so that it will be easy for the player to find them.

[[[unity-npc-model]]]

If you choose the Cat, Rat, or Raccoon, then you can set the **Animator Controller** to the **IdleWalk** animation.

Add a **Box Collider** to the **Quest Giver** so that the Player can't walk through them.

The Quest Giver will offer the Player a quest when they get close enough.

Add a UI **TextMeshPro** named `Quest Text` as a **child of the Quest Giver** and add your quest message to it.

Change the message text, settings, and position of the text object until you are happy:

You can add another UI **TextMeshPro** to the same canvas with the name of the Quest Giver NPC if you like.

Add a **Box Collider** with a **Trigger** and a **QuestGiver** script on the Quest Giver NPC to make the quest message appear when the Player is nearby.

Add another **Box Collider** with the Trigger property checked. This Box Collider needs to be bigger than the first Box Collider so that the Player can trigger the Quest Giver to display a text box.

![The Box Collider component with x = 3 and z = 3 to give a large range. 'Is Trigger' is selected.](images/box-trigger.png)

Add a script called **QuestGiver** to the **QuestGiver GameObject**. Add `OnTriggerEnter` and `OnTriggerExit` methods to show and hide the message canvas when the Player gets close and moves away. 

Add code to a script on the NPC GameObject.

For this quest, the item to be collected should only appear once the quest has been accepted. 

--- task ---

Add an **Accept Button** to the Canvas on your Quest Giver NPC and connect it to a `QuestAccepted` method on your **QuestGiver** script. Update the **QuestGiver** script so the item only appears when the quest has been accepted.

Add a UI **TextMesh Pro Button** to the same canvas and click on the **Text (TMP)** child object of the Button then give it the text `Accept`: 

![The TextMeshPro component with Text Input 'Accept'.](images/text-button.png)

Adjust the Button and text size, position, and colours until you are happy with them:

Add code to the QuestGiver script to control when the object appears so that it only appears when then quest has been accepted.

Select the **Quest Giver**, then in the **QuestGiver** script component in the Inspector window, drag your **Button** and **Item GameObjects** to the Button and Item properties:

![The QuestGiver script component with 'Button' in the Button variable and 'QuestItem' in the Item variable.](images/item-script.png)

From the Hierarchy window, select the **Button GameObject** then go to the Inspector window `OnClick()` property and click on the **+**.

Click on the circle for the field underneath 'Runtime', click on **Scene** and choose your **Quest Giver**. In the Function drop-down menu, select **QuestGiver.QuestAccepted** to join your new method to the Buttonâ€™s click event:

![The 'OnClick()' function of the button with 'QuestGiver' populated to the left and 'QuestGiver.QuestAccepted' to the right.](images/button-click.png)

**Tip:** If you have a Canvas as a child object then you won't be able to focus on the parent GameObject in the Scene view. To fix this, you can disable the Canvas in the Inspector, by unchecking the box next to the name. If you need to see the Canvas again to edit it, you can check the box. 

![The Inspector window for the Canvas, showing that the Canvas is unselected with an empty check box to the left of the name.](images/canvas-unchecked.png)

**Test:** Play your scene:
+ Check that your item does not appear at the start 
+ Go and talk to the Quest Giver and accept the quest 
+ Make sure that the item appears when the quest is accepted 
+ Also check that the 'Accept' button disappears and isn't shown again if you return to the Quest Giver 

**Debug:**

--- collapse ---

---
title: Nothing happens when I click the Accept button
---

Select your **Quest Giver NPC** and make sure they have a script that has an `QuestAccepted` method.

Check that all the variables are set on the script in the Inspector. 

Click on the **Button** object and check that you have attached the correct method such as `QuestAccepted` to an `OnClick` event. 

Add a `Debug.Log("Quest accepted");` line to the method and check the console to see that the method is being called.

If you are sure the method is being called, check that the code in the method is correct. 

If the method is not being called (no Debug output), then make sure you have an `EventSystem` GameObject in your project. If you accidentally delete this, then button-clicks won't be handled. If it's missing, right-click in the Hierarch window and choose **UI** then **Event System**.

When the Player collects the item, the item needs to disappear and optionally play a sound effect. The Quest Giver will also need to know when the quest has been completed.

Add a UI **TextMeshPro** to the scene to display the reward. Add a **QuestSeeker** script to the Player to store and update the reward.

title: Add a QuestSeeker script to the Player to manage the reward

Right-click in the Hierarchy window and add a UI **TextMeshPro** to your scene to show the reward. Name the new object `Coin Text`, or a suitable name for your reward. 

Add a new **QuestSeeker** script component to the Player to store and display the reward. 

The `coins` variable needs to be `public` so that a script on the Quest Item can update it.

Add a `public bool hasQuestItem = false;` variable to the **QuestSeeker** script. The variable needs to be `public` so that a script on the item sets it to `true` when the item is collected.

Add a **Box Collider** with a **Trigger** and **QuestItemController** script to your Quest Item. Add code to hide the Quest Item and set `hasQuestItem` to true on the Player's QuestSeeker script when the Player collides with the Quest Item.

Select the **Quest Item** and add a **Box Collider** with a **Trigger**. 

Add a **script** to the **Quest Item** and name it `QuestItemController`.

Add code to make the item hide and update the `hasQuestItem` status on the Player.

Drag the **Player GameObject** to the Player property of the QuestItemController script in the Inspector for the Quest Item.

Optionally, also play a sound when the item is collected.

**Test:** Play your scene:
+ Talk to the Quest Giver NPC and accept the quest 
+ Check that you can collect the Quest Item 
+ While you are still in Play mode, click on the Player and check that the `hasQuestItem` property in the Inspector window is checked to show that the quest item has been collected

Check that the Quest Item has a script with an `OnTriggerEnter` method that deactivates the Quest Item when the Player collides with it. 

Make sure you have added a Box Collider with a Trigger and that the collider is bigger than any non-trigger colliders so that the Player is able to trigger it. 

Check that the Player GameObject has the Player tag.
