## Introduction

Add NPCs and quests to the world that you created in the [World Builder](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/world-builder) project.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**quest**</span> is a task or mission in a computer game that the player can complete to gain a reward or move the story forward. Quests can require a player to fetch or deliver an item, gather items, escort a character to a location, find out information or solve a puzzle. On completion a player could be rewarded with experience, coins, access to new areas or new abilities.
</p>

You will:
+ Add an NPC with dialogue that changes based on game state
+ Manage the state of a quest using one or more variables
+ Give behaviour to Player and NPCs to complete one or more quests (gather, escort, deliver).

### Try it 

Play the quests in the example project. Think about the type of quest and the outcome.  
+ What is the reward for completing the quest? 
+ How do the NPCs interact with the player?
+ How are items used in the quest?
