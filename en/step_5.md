## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:

+ Improve the appearance of the UI Text using font colours and coloured UI Panels. 
+ Add multiple quests to the same NPC so that they offer you a new quest when you complete a quest.
+ Allow some quests to reset so they can be completed multiple times to earn more XP or coins. 
+ Allow the player to choose between different questions by using multiple buttons.

You could also add different kinds of quest:
+ A **story** question where you have to find and talk to another NPC to find out information.
+ A **puzzle** or **task** quest where you have to solve a puzzle or complete a task.

<mark> Optional </mark>Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.
