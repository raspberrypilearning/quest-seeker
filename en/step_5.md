## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:

+ Improve the appearance of the UI Text using font colours and coloured UI Panels 
+ Add multiple quests to the same NPC so that they offer you a new quest when you complete a quest
+ Allow some quests to reset so they can be completed multiple times to earn more XP or coins 
+ Allow the player to choose between different questions by using multiple buttons
